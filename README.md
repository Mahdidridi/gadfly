# Rhombus 

If you don't know what's going on here, all of the information about the project in general is [in the wiki](https://github.com/ndvr/gadfly/wiki).

Here's where you can play with the [current working iteration](http://rhombus-forum.herokuapp.com/#/).

This was all built primarily with nodejs, angularjs, socketio, and springyjs (a force-directed
graph library.)

## Getting started
Install the following packages:  
	* nodejs  
For OS X using Homebrew do:  
```sh
$ brew install nodejs
```  
For Ubuntu and derivatives do:  
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

For Arch do:  
```sh
$ sudo pacman -S nodejs
```
Next install node package dependencies:

```
To run the app do:
