# Rhombus (probably)

rhombus-forum.herokuapp.com

Rhombus is kind of hard to explain, and I always do a terrible job of it.  

Essentially, it's a scaffold for arguments.  Conversations unfold like graphs,
each point someone has to make is a node, and this paragraph is really lame.    

Okay, so forums today are, like, dumb, because discussions on forums are linear,
but discussions aren't really linear at all.  If people are trying to have constructive 
discourse on a subject on the internet, it's usually not possible because ideas that people have, even when
well intentioned, become untraceably divergent.  

Rhombus is, like, a thing that I kind of started to build to address this maybe problem.
It allows the quality of arguments to be 
quantified in some respects, and provides a means of organizing the complexity inevitably 
associated with things (since I suspect things are actually just really complicated). 
This is cool because arguments on the internet might be able to get somewhere.  

All responses take one of these forms
-agreement: An explanation of why you agree with something.  The net value of an agreement is added to whatever 
it is directed at.
-disagreement: Same thing, except it's disagreement and it's subtracted.
-comment: A neutral statement 
-quote: Since there's no text limit on responses, quotes provide a mean to break up a response into constituent parts which can individually be argued over to affect the whole.  
-link: If two points are logically the same, you can "link" them together.  This essentially makes all arguments for or against either one of the points apply to both.  The strength of the link can be individually argued over.

Um, please help me build this?  

## Usage Guide

Here's the current semantic guidelines for interacting on the site.

Don't really use comments unless what you're saying is truly neutral.  Comments tend to bork up arguments
because people will divulge into discussions that are related to the original topic conceptually but not 
numerucically.

Try not to phrase arguments as questions.  Socrates is my homey too, but questions tend to be disagreements
and can usually be phrased as statements.  You can't really disagree with a question.
